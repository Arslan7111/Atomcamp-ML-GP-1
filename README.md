 Admissions Optimizer 

This project builds a decision support tool for Global Tech University to flag high-probability admits and forecast scholarship allocations using machine learning regression models.

 Dataset 
 Admissions data (GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, CGPA, Research, Chance of Admit).

 Key Tasks 
- Multiple Linear Regression for baseline analysis.  
- Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressors with hyperparameter tuning.  
- Multicollinearity handling using VIF.  
- Feature selection based on Random Forest importance.  
- Retraining models on top 5 features for comparison.  
- Visualizations for feature relationships.


 Results 
- Models are evaluated using R² score & RMSE.  
- Key features identified for accurate predictions.
